Since starting Kippt, we have used Kippt to build Kippt. It's extremely useful and soothing when you have a single shared place for all of the important stuff.

<div class="full zoomable"><p><img src="/images/blog-cover.jpg" alt=""></p></div>

You can share links to your team, make notes (ideas, memos or questions) and discuss about important files. Inc ends up as your private company knowledge base, where ideas, discussions and decisions are archived in one place. And everything is searchable.

<div class="sidequote"><blockquote><p>“Effective companies tend to communicate more, their people are curious and they have opinions.</p></blockquote></div>
